# Rosalana Organization

Welcome to the **Rosalana** GitHub organization!

Rosalana is an ecosystem designed to enhance creativity and efficiency by connecting innovative applications and services. Our goal is to empower individuals and teams through tools that streamline processes, improve collaboration, and support creative endeavors.

## Applications and Services

Here are the key components of the Rosalana ecosystem:

- **Rosalana: Social Network**  
  A platform for creators to connect, share, and monetize their work. Combining features of social media and creative platforms, it allows users to publish stories, artworks, and other content. Monetization options include subscriptions, collections, or chapter-based releases. Additionally, creators can track their popularity and achieve milestones.

- **Rosalana: Spectrum**  
  A management tool focused on handling a company's administrative processes. Spectrum is designed for tasks like employee management (vacations, roles, internal communication), and automating administrative documents (contracts, payslips, and invoices) using predefined templates. It also includes a calendar for planning and organizing work. While Spectrum provides basic tools for initializing and managing tasks and projects, more detailed project tracking is handled by Blueprint. For example, Spectrum can log working hours and act as the starting point for creating more detailed projects in Blueprint.

- **Rosalana: Blueprint**  
  A platform for creating structured, multi-step workflows that improve collaboration between companies and clients. Blueprint simplifies team collaboration and tracks project progress, ensuring clear and transparent workflows. Its tools are tailored to help businesses create well-defined project plans and keep progress straightforward.
