# Rosalana Organization

Welcome to the **Rosalana** GitHub organization!

**Rosalana** is a growing ecosystem of open-source tools and Laravel-based packages designed to enhance creativity, streamline collaboration, and support the development of modern web applications.

Whether you're building internal tools, creative platforms, or full-stack apps — Rosalana is here to help you move faster and keep things modular.

> ⚠️ **This ecosystem is currently in active development and not yet released for production. Use with caution.**  
> We are preparing a stable release soon.

## 🚧 Applications

Rosalana includes several apps that will be released gradually:

- **Blueprint** — A layered form editor for gathering website or project requirements from clients.
- **Spectrum** — A internal information system for companies and creative teams.
- **Spotlight** — Timeline-based presentation tool for live events and film premieres.
- *(...and more coming soon)*

> Applications are not published yet — stay tuned!

## 📦 Packages

We're building a collection of reusable Laravel packages to unify and simplify development across Rosalana projects:

- [`rosalana/core`](https://github.com/rosalana/core) – The shared foundation for all other packages.
- [`rosalana/accounts`](https://github.com/rosalana/accounts) – User management and authentication layer.
- *(Additional packages are in development.)*

All packages follow a unified versioning standard and can be managed using the Rosalana CLI.
